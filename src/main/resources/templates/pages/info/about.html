            kernel panic is a minimal reddit clone, is heavily community-based and completely free. <br>
            kernel panic provides a small community building service based on categories, channels. <br>
            it also provides a rich-text post creation service based on categories and tags, associated with channels. <br>
            it is also possible to generate discussions connected to a post by creating replies and comments. <br>
            small communities can manage themselves independently through the hierarchy of roles structured in a minimal way within the platform. <br>
            these and other features, such as the "subscription to a channel" service or the "notification" service, are only available for registered users. <br>
            guest users will have full free access to all channels and posts on the platform for viewing only.
